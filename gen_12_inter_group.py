gen_12_inter_group.py
=====================
Inter-group multi-tool scenarios using the REAL Suwon catalog tools
(from tools_summary.md). Every seed forces tool calls that span
≥2 distinct groups.

Group naming below uses the markdown section headers, lowercased and
underscored. Make sure these names match the GROUP_NAME values in your
gen_01..gen_11 scripts — if any of them differ, just rename the keys
in ALLOWLISTS_BY_GROUP to match.

Themes covered:
    A. battery_power     + communication      ("phone dying, text my friend")
    B. system_device     + communication      ("share my diagnostics with IT")
    C. personal_info     + display_ui         ("add exam tomorrow, dim screen")
    D. connectivity      + battery_power      ("WiFi off, log battery")
    E. notifications     + personal_info      ("mute except alarms for 1h")
    F. clipboard         + communication      ("copy this and share it")
    G. memory_files      + communication      ("find the report and share")
    H. apps              + personal_info      ("set alarm, open Strava")
    I. audio             + notifications      ("silent mode, check DND")
    J. battery_power     + display_ui         ("dim screen, save battery")
